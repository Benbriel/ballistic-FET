# ballistic-FET

3. 2-d ballistic FET
(a) Numerically calculate the current-voltage characteristics of a single mode 2-d ballistic
FET using Eq. (5.51) and a self consistent solution for the potential, U. Plot your solution
for T = 1K and T = 298K. In each plot, consider the voltage range 0 < VDS < 0.5, at
VGS = 0.3 V, 0.35 V, 0.4V, 0.45V and 0.5V. In your calculation take the bottom of the
conduction band to be -4.7 eV, the Fermi Energy at equilibrium EF = -5.0 eV, L = 40nm,
W = 3 × L, and CG = 0.1 fF. Assume CD = CS = 0. Take the effective mass, m, as
m = 0.5 × m0, where m0 = 9.1x10-31 kg.
You should obtain the IV characteristics shown in Fig. 5.26.

(b) Next, compare your numerical solutions to the analytic solution for the linear and
saturation regions (Eqns (5.60) and (5.61)). Explain the discrepancies.
(c) Numerically determine IDS vs VGS at VDS = 0.5V and T = 298K. Plot the current on a
logarithmic scale to demonstrate that the transconductance is 60mV/decade in the
subthreshold region.
(d) Using your plot in (c), choose a new VT such that the analytic solution for the
saturation region (Eq. (5.61)) provides a better fit at room temperature. Explain your
choice.
